# cppND-capstone-Yolov3-object-detection

<img src="output/out.jpg"/>

This repository contains an implementation of the project in [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213).

I use OpenCV and Yolov3 to implement a highly capable object detection model. It takes in single image and outputs the annotated image based on the object detector's predictions. 

The fulfilled rubic points are as follows:

1- A README with instructions is included with the project.
2- The README indicates which project is chosen.
3- The README includes information about each rubric point addressed.
4- The submission must compile and run.
5- The project demonstrates an understanding of C++ functions and control structures.
6- The project reads data from a file and process the data, or the program writes data to a file.
7- The project accepts user input and processes the input.
8- The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques.
9- Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members.
10- Class constructors utilize member initialization lists.
11- Classes abstract implementation details from their interfaces.
12- Classes encapsulate behavior.
13- Classes follow an appropriate inheritance hierarchy.
14- Derived class functions override virtual base class functions.
15- Templates generalize functions in the project.
16- The project makes use of references in function declarations.
17- The project uses destructors appropriately.
18- The project uses scope / Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) where appropriate.
19- The project uses move semantics to move data, instead of copying it, where possible.
20- The project uses smart pointers instead of raw pointers.
21- The project uses multithreading.
22- A promise and future is used in the project.
23- A mutex or lock is used in the project.
24- A condition variable is used in the project.
